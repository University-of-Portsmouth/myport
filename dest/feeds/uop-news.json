In September the final five candidates pitched their refined business plans at the Ocean Village Innovation Centre Southampton, to a panel of judges in a \u2018Dragon\u2019s Den\u2019 style event.<\/p>\n<p>The results will be announced tomorrow and the winner will secure a prize fund worth up to \u00a350k worth of business products and services.

The judges especially look for a breadth of skills across different genres and the quality across the Portsmouth submissions this year secured them first prize.<\/p>\n<p>Principal Lecturer, Ben Thompson, Section Lead Film and Broadcasting, said that the quality of the submissions reflected the calibre of the teaching and the continued investment in industry-standard equipment.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll of our staff come from the film or television industry and this is reflected in how they teach, with a strong focus on cinematography. The fact that our students can produce films of professional industry standard and demonstrate creativity and quality in camera craft impressed the judges. It\u2019s also what makes our students highly employable in the industry.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe recently invested heavily in professional ARRi ALEXA cameras, which are used on today\u2019s top feature films. The superiority of these cameras is evident in the quality of the films and is another ingredient in the overall production values of our students\u2019 work.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Josh Davies, who is a 2016 graduate of the course, was also shortlisted for an individual award for his music video, EKKOES. The drama submission was by Danny Ellis for Paenitenia, the story of a son who returns home to reconcile his broken relationship with his father decades after being exiled, and the documentary was A Step Too Far by Jon Cook about a group of dedicated young gymnasts.

If we are anxious, we often end up organising our lives around our fears and this can be very restricting.

Based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), a well-proven educational psychological approach, this course will teach participants to identify and manage the triggers and symptoms of anxiety, to gain insight and to practice skills to cope.

Mindfulness is a simple training technique that encourages heightened awareness of the here and now and the development of a non-judgemental acceptance. It promotes ways of staying with what is, rather than thinking about what might have been or worrying about what could be. Regular mindful practice can lead to more informed decisions about how you lead your life and this course will enable you to discover if this approach can work for you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For more information or to book a place on this workshop:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Email <a href=\"mailto:wellbeing-admin@port.ac.uk\">wellbeing-admin@port.ac.uk<\/a>;\u00a0phone 023 9284 3466; or call in to the Nuffield Reception<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Five different workshops to improve your wellbeing. <\/p>\n","date":"2016-10-07 16:32:04","modified":"2016-10-07 16:33:05","categories":[{"id":9,"slug":"students","title":"Students","description":"","parent":0,"post_count":1461}],"tags":[],"author":{"id":2,"slug":"internal-comms","name":"Internal Comms","first_name":"","last_name":"","nickname":"Internal Comms","url":"","description":""},"comments":[],"attachments":[],"comment_count":0,"comment_status":"open","thumbnail":"http:\/\/uopnews.port.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/Wellbeing-150x150.jpg","custom_fields":{"usn_highlight":["off"],"usn_ec":["off"],"usn_slider":["off"],"usn_show_in_video":["off"],"postpublishdate":[""],"postexpiry":[""],"homepage_category_display":[""]},"thumbnail_size":"thumbnail","thumbnail_images":{"full":{"url":"http:\/\/uopnews.port.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/Wellbeing.jpg","width":1000,"height":582},"thumbnail":{"url":"http:\/\/uopnews.port.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/Wellbeing-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150},"medium":{"url":"http:\/\/uopnews.port.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/Wellbeing-300x174.jpg","width":300,"height":174},"large":{"url":"http:\/\/uopnews.port.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/Wellbeing.jpg","width":1000,"height":582},"micro":{"url":"http:\/\/uopnews.port.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/Wellbeing-50x50.jpg","width":50,"height":50},"mini":{"url":"http:\/\/uopnews.port.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/Wellbeing-140x90.jpg","width":140,"height":90},"mini-ec":{"url":"http:\/\/uopnews.port.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/Wellbeing-135x80.jpg","width":135,"height":80},"general":{"url":"http:\/\/uopnews.port.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/Wellbeing-300x180.jpg","width":300,"height":180},"slide-home":{"url":"http:\/\/uopnews.port.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/Wellbeing-360x225.jpg","width":360,"height":225},"slide-magazine":{"url":"http:\/\/uopnews.port.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/Wellbeing-620x380.jpg","width":620,"height":380},"video-mini":{"url":"http:\/\/uopnews.port.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/Wellbeing-134x74.jpg","width":134,"height":74},"video":{"url":"http:\/\/uopnews.port.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/Wellbeing-460x260.jpg","width":460,"height":260}}},{"id":33538,"type":"post","slug":"football-opportunities-for-females","url":"http:\/\/uopnews.port.ac.uk\/2016\/10\/06\/football-opportunities-for-females\/","status":"publish","title":"Football opportunities for females","title_plain":"Football opportunities for females","content":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/uopnews.port.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/football_woman.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1866838364\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"33538\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-21798\" src=\"http:\/\/uopnews.port.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/football_woman-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"football_woman\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"http:\/\/uopnews.port.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/football_woman-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/uopnews.port.ac.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/football_woman-50x50.jpg 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a>The Department of Sport and Recreation is running a series of football opportunities for all female students, staff and community members throughout 10\u201316 October, including playing and coaching events:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mon 10 Oct, 6.30pm\u20137.30pm, drop-in football session at Langstone Campus (open to all female students)<\/li>\n<li>Tues 11 Oct, 4.00pm in Eldon W1.02, Football Coaching Introduction<\/li>\n<li>Thurs 13 Oct, 5.30pm\u20137.00pm, girls aged 10\u201316yrs drop-in football session at Langstone Campus<\/li>\n<li>Thurs 13 Oct, 6.00pm\u20137.00pm, drop-in football session at Langstone Campus (open to all females 16 yrs +)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>No previous experience is necessary, so if you just want to try something new, come and give it a go!
